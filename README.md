# Why another `react-bytes` repo?
Well a few reasons. My [react-bytes](https://github.com/1Copenut/react-bytes) repo was created before I understood the value of workspaces and shared dependencies. Lately it's been more and more work to keep deps up to date and I wanted to use lighter tooling like Vite.

Turns out, `create-react-app` doesn't work so well with monorepos. So I decided now was as good a time as any to create...another repo...and rebuild things with the end in mind.
